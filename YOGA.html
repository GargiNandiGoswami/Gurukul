        <p><h3><b>History</b></h3>
            There is no consensus on yoga's chronology or origins other than its development in ancient India. There are two broad theories 
            explaining the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga has Vedic origins (as reflected in Vedic texts), and influenced 
            Buddhism. This model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of indigenous, 
            non-Vedic practices with Vedic elements. This model is favoured in Western scholarship.<br>
            Speculations about yoga began to emerge in the early Upanishads of the first half of the first millennium BCE, with expositions 
            also appearing in Jain and Buddhist texts c. 500  c.200 BCE. Between 200 BCE and 500 CE, traditions of Hindu, Buddhist, and 
            Jain philosophy were taking shape; teachings were collected as sutras, and a philosophical system of Patanjaliyogasastra began to emerge. 
            The Middle Ages saw the development of a number of yoga satellite traditions. It and other aspects of Indian philosophy came to 
            the attention of the educated Western public during the mid-19th century.</p>
            <p><h3><b>ORIGIN</b></h3>
                <B>Linear model</B><BR>
                According to Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, Hindu researchers have favoured a linear theory which attempts "to interpret 
                the origin and early development of Indian contemplative practices as a sequential growth from an Aryan genesis"; 
                traditional Hinduism regards the Vedas as the source of all spiritual knowledge. Edwin Bryant wrote that authors who support 
                Indigenous Aryanism also tend to support the linear model.<BR><BR>
                <B>Synthesis model</B><BR>
                Heinrich Zimmer was an exponent of the synthesis model, arguing for non-Vedic eastern states of India. According to 
                Zimmer, yoga is part of a non-Vedic system which includes the Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, Jainism and Buddhism: 
                "[Jainism] does not derive from Brahman-Aryan sources, but reflects the cosmology and anthropology of a much older pre-Aryan 
                upper class of northeastern India [Bihar]  being rooted in the same subsoil of archaic metaphysical speculation as Yoga, 
                Sankhya, and Buddhism, the other non-Vedic Indian systems." Richard Gombrich and Geoffrey Samuel believe that the śramaṇa 
                movement originated in non-Vedic Greater Magadha.<BR>
                Thomas McEvilley favors a composite model in which a pre-Aryan yoga prototype existed in the pre-Vedic period and was 
                refined during the Vedic period. According to Gavin D. Flood, the Upanishads differ fundamentally from the Vedic ritual 
                tradition and indicate non-Vedic influences. However, the traditions may be connected:<BR>
                This dichotomization is too simplistic, for continuities can undoubtedly be found between renunciation and vedic Brahmanism, 
                while elements from non-Brahmanical, Sramana traditions also played an important part in the formation of the renunciate ideal
                The ascetic traditions of the eastern Ganges plain are thought to drew from a common body of practices and philosophies, 
                with proto-samkhya concepts of purusha and prakriti as a common denominator.<BR><BR>
                <B>Indus Valley Civilisation</B><BR>
                The twentieth-century scholars Karel Werner, Thomas McEvilley, and Mircea Eliade believe that the central figure of the 
                Pashupati seal is in a Mulabandhasana posture, and the roots of yoga are in the Indus Valley civilisation. This is 
                rejected by more recent scholarship; for example, Geoffrey Samuel, Andrea R. Jain, and Wendy Doniger describe the 
                identification as speculative; the meaning of the figure will remain unknown until Harappan script is deciphered, 
                and the roots of yoga cannot be linked to the IVC.</p><center>
