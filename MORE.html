                <P>The importance of the Gurukul system in present times</B>
                    The main focus of Gurukuls was on imparting learning to the students in a natural surrounding where the shisyas lived 
                    with each other with brotherhood, humanity, love, and discipline. The essential teachings were in subjects like language, 
                    science, mathematics through group discussions, self-learning etc. Not only this, but the focus was also given on arts, 
                    sports, crafts, singing that developed their intelligence and critical thinking. Activities such as yoga, meditation, 
                    mantra chanting etc generated positivity and peace of mind and made them fit. It was also mandatory to do daily chores 
                    on own with a motive to impart practical skills in them. All these helped in the personality development and increased 
                    there confidence, sense of discipline, intellect and mindfulness which is necessary even today to face the world that lay ahead.
                    
                   <h2><B>Flaws in the present education system</B></h2>
                    Unfortunately, the above concept has disappeared and the modern system of education brought to India in the year 1835 
                    by Lord Macauley is all about rat race to be ahead of others. There is a total absence of personality development, 
                    creation of moral conscience and ethical training. One of the biggest flaws about this education is that it is more 
                    commercial in nature rather than an institutional concept that should impart holistic learning to the students. It 
                    devotes very less time for physical activity and the development of other skill sets that can assist a student to 
                    become a better human being.
                    
                    <h2><b>Advantages of studying in a ‘Gurukul’</b></h2>
                    The ‘Gurukul’ system of education is the epitome of Indian style of learning. Basically, a gurukul is a school where 
                    students live along with their mentors and receive education, moral values and life skills under their guidance. 
                    This process of learning is being practiced since early ages in India. Gurukul has mythological connotations. 
                    ‘Luv-Kush’, the ‘Pandavas’, ‘Pralaadh’, ‘Arjun’ and even Lord Krishna studied in a ‘Gurukul’. Even today, gurukul 
                    holds significance as it is known to develop the students holistically.

                    So, if you’re looking to send your child to a school where he/she can gain moral values along with excellent education, 
                    then you must send your child to a ‘gurukul’.<br><br>

                    <i><b>Here are some advantages of ‘gurukul’ over other schools which denote how your child would be benefited by studying here:-</b></i><br><br>

                    1. The students of gurukul are more disciplined and organized. They are taught to follow a well- planned schedule in school.<br>
                    2. The students are more focused and possess more concentration power than normal students. This is because they are trained through techniques such as meditation which enhances their focusing power.<br>
                    3. In a gurukul, students are taught to respect everyone irrespective of their caste, creed, ethnicity, culture, religion and perspective. So, such students grow up as people with strong character and values.<br>
                    4. The ‘guru-shishya parampara’ is an integral part of Gurukul. Here, the students highly respect their teachers and share a good bond with them. They are molded under the guidance of their mentors.<br>
                    5. In a gurukul, ‘gurus’ also take complete responsibility for their ‘shishyas’. They share their experiences, inculcate good habits and mold the character of the students in a positive direction.<br>
                    6. The students are developed into strong individuals. They are taught to stay firm and face any adverse situation in the outside world.<br>
                    7. Gurukul students are taught to value nature. So, they are very close to nature. They worship nature and also learn a lot of things from it.<br>
                    8. Students are spiritually elevated which gives them an optimistic, calm and composed personality.<br>
                    9. Every student is given proper attention as the student-teacher ratio is properly planned, unlike other schools where students aren’t given individual attention.<br>
                    10. Gurukul emphasizes on practical knowledge which is quite beneficial to build the concepts of the students.<br>
                    11. Students are taught to follow the principle of ‘simple living and high thinking’ which is a great lesson for life.<br></P>
