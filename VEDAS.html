            <P>The Vedas are the religious texts which inform the religion of Hinduism (also known as Sanatan Dharma meaning “Eternal Order” 
                or “Eternal Path”). The term veda means “knowledge” in that they are thought to contain the fundamental knowledge relating to 
                the underlying cause of, function of, and personal response to existence.</P>
            <P>The Vedas existed in oral form and were passed down from master to student for generations until they were committed to writing 
                between c. 1500 c. 500 BCE (the so-called Vedic Period) in India. They were carefully preserved orally as masters would have 
                students memorize them forwards and backwards with emphasis on exact pronunciation in order to keep what was originally heard intact.</P>
            <P>There are four Vedas: the Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda and the Atharvaveda. Each Veda has four subdivisions the Samhitas 
                (mantras and benedictions), the Brahmanas (commentaries on and explanation of rituals, ceremonies and sacrifices - Yajnas), the 
                Aranyakas (text on rituals, ceremonies, sacrifices and symbolic-sacrifices), and the Upanishads (texts discussing meditation, 
                philosophy and spiritual knowledge). Some scholars add a fifth category the Upasanas (worship). The texts of the Upanishads 
                discuss ideas akin to the heterodox sramana traditions. The Samhitas and Brahmanas describe about daily rituals and are generally 
                meant for Brahmacharya and Grihastha stages of the Chaturasrama system, while the Aranyakas and Upanishads are meant for the Vānaprastha 
                and Sannyasa stages, respectively.</P>

                The Rigveda Samhita is the oldest extant Indic text. It is a collection of 1,028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10,600 verses in all, 
                organized into ten books (Sanskrit: mandalas). The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities.        
                The books were composed by poets from different priestly groups over a period of several centuries between c. 1500 and 1200 BCE, 
                (the early Vedic period) in the Punjab (Sapta Sindhu) region of the northwest Indian subcontinent. According to Michael Witzel, the 
                initial codification of the Rigveda took place at the end of the Rigvedic period at c. 1200 BCE, in the early Kuru kingdom.    
                The Rigveda is structured based on clear principles. The Veda begins with a small book addressed to Agni, Indra, Soma and other gods, 
                all arranged according to decreasing total number of hymns in each deity collection; for each deity series, the hymns progress from 
                longer to shorter ones, but the number of hymns per book increases. Finally, the meter too is systematically arranged from jagati and 
                tristubh to anustubh and gayatri as the text progresses.
                The rituals became increasingly complex over time, and the king's association with them strengthened both the position of 
                the Brahmans and the kings. The Rajasuya rituals, performed with the coronation of a king, "set in motion cyclical regenerations 
                of the universe." In terms of substance, the nature of hymns shift from praise of deities in early books to Nasadiya Sukta with 
                questions such as, "what is the origin of the universe?, do even gods know the answer?", the virtue of Dāna (charity) in society, and other metaphysical issues in its hymns.
                There are similarities between the mythology, rituals and linguistics in Rigveda and those found in ancient central Asia, Iranian and Hindukush (Afghanistan) regions.</P>

                The Samaveda Samhita consists of 1549 stanzas, taken almost entirely (except for 75 mantras) from the Rigveda. While its earliest parts 
                are believed to date from as early as the Rigvedic period, the existing compilation dates from the post-Rigvedic Mantra period of Vedic 
                Sanskrit, between c. 1200 and 1000 BCE or "slightly later," roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda and the Yajurveda.                    The Samaveda samhita has two major parts. The first part includes four melody collections and the second part three verse “books” (ārcika, आर्चिक). 
                A melody in the song books corresponds to a verse in the arcika books. Just as in the Rigveda, the early sections of Samaveda typically 
                begin with hymns to Agni and Indra but shift to the abstract. Their meters shift also in a descending order. The songs in the later 
                sections of the Samaveda have the least deviation from the hymns derived from the Rigveda.
                In the Samaveda, some of the Rigvedic verses are repeated. Including repetitions, there are a total of 1875 verses 
                numbered in the Samaveda recension translated by Griffith. Two major recensions have survived, the Kauthuma/Ranayaniya and 
                the Jaiminiya. Its purpose was liturgical, and they were the repertoire of the udgātṛ or "singer" priests.</P>

                The Yajurveda Samhita consists of prose mantras. It is a compilation of ritual offering formulas that were said by 
                a priest while an individual performed ritual actions such as those before the yajna fire. The core text of the Yajurveda 
                falls within the classical Mantra period of Vedic Sanskrit at the end of the 2nd millennium BCE younger than the Rigveda, 
                and roughly contemporary with the Atharvaveda, the Rigvedic Khilani, and the Sāmaveda. Witzel dates the Yajurveda hymns to 
                the early Indian Iron Age, after c. 1200 and before 800 BCE. corresponding to the early Kuru Kingdom.
                A page from the Taittiriya Samhita, a layer of text within the Yajurveda
                The earliest and most ancient layer of Yajurveda samhita includes about 1,875 verses, that are distinct yet borrow and build 
                upon the foundation of verses in Rigveda. Unlike the Samaveda which is almost entirely based on Rigveda mantras and structured 
                as songs, the Yajurveda samhitas are in prose, and they are different from earlier Vedic texts linguistically. The Yajur Veda 
                has been the primary source of information about sacrifices during Vedic times and associated rituals.
                There are two major groups of texts in this Veda: the "Black" (Krishna) and the "White" (Shukla). The term "black" implies 
                "the un-arranged, motley collection" of verses in Yajurveda, in contrast to the "white" (well arranged) Yajurveda. The White 
                Yajurveda separates the Samhita from its Brahmana (the Shatapatha Brahmana), the Black Yajurveda intersperses the Samhita with 
                Brahmana commentary. Of the Black Yajurveda, texts from four major schools have survived (Maitrayani, Katha, Kapisthala-Katha, 
                Taittiriya), while of the White Yajurveda, two (Kanva and Madhyandina). The youngest layer of Yajurveda text is not related to 
                rituals nor sacrifice, it includes the largest collection of primary Upanishads, influential to various schools of Hindu philosophy.</P>

                The Artharvaveda Samhita is the text 'belonging to the Atharvan and Angirasa poets. It has about 760 hymns, and about 
                160 of the hymns are in common with the Rigveda.[170] Most of the verses are metrical, but some sections are in prose. 
                Two different versions of the text the Paippalāda and the Śaunakīya have survived into the modern times. The Atharvaveda 
                was not considered as a Veda in the Vedic era, and was accepted as a Veda in late 1st millennium BCE. .
                The Atharvaveda is sometimes called the "Veda of magical formulas", an epithet declared to be incorrect by other scholars. 
                The Samhita layer of the text likely represents a developing 2nd millennium BCE tradition of magico-religious rites to address 
                superstitious anxiety, spells to remove maladies believed to be caused by demons, and herbs- and nature-derived potions as medicine.
                The text, states Kenneth Zysk, is one of oldest surviving record of the evolutionary practices in religious medicine and reveals the 
                "earliest forms of folk healing of Indo-European antiquity".                             
                The Atharva veda has been a primary source for information about Vedic culture, the customs and beliefs, the aspirations and frustrations 
                of everyday Vedic life, as well as those associated with kings and governance. The text also includes hymns dealing with the two major 
                rituals of passage marriage and cremation. The Atharva Veda also dedicates significant portion of the text asking the meaning of a ritual.</P>
