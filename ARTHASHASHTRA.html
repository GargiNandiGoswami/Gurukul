           <p><img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\artha.jpg"></p></center>
           <p>The Sanskrit title, Arthashastra, can be translated as "political science" or "economic science" or simply "statecraft",
             as the word artha (अर्थ) is polysemous in Sanskrit; the work has a broad scope. It includes books on the nature of government, law,
             civil and criminal court systems, ethics, economics, markets and trade, the methods for screening ministers, diplomacy, theories
             on war, nature of peace, and the duties and obligations of a king. The text incorporates Hindu philosophy, includes ancient
             economic and cultural details on agriculture, mineralogy, mining and metals, animal husbandry, medicine, forests and wildlife.

           <p><b>Kauṭilya or Kauṭalya</b><br>
            The text identifies its author by the name "Kauṭilya" or its variant "Kauṭalya": both spellings appear in manuscripts, commentaries,
            and references in other ancient texts; it is not certain which one of these is the original spelling of the author's name. This
            person was probably the author of the original recension of Arthashastra: this recension must have been based on works by earlier
            writers, as suggested by the Arthashastra's opening verse, which states that its author consulted the so-called "Arthashastras" 
            to compose a new treatise.<br>
            Vishakhadatta's Mudrarakshasa refers to Kauṭilya as kutila-mati ("crafty-minded"), which has led to suggestions that the word 
            "Kauṭilya" is derived from kutila, the Sanskrit word for "crafty". However, such a derivation is grammatically impossible, and 
            Vishkhadatta's usage is simply a pun. The word "Kauṭilya" or "Kauṭalya" appears to be the name of a gotra (lineage), and is 
            used in this sense in the later literature and inscriptions.</p>
        <p><b>Vishnugupta</b>
            A verse at the end of the text identifies its author as "Vishnugupta" (Viṣṇugupta), stating that Vishnugupta himself composed 
            both the text and its commentary, after noticing "many errors committed by commentators on treatises". R. P. Kangle theorized 
            that Vishnugupta was the personal name of the author while Chanakya (Cāṇakya) was the name of his gotra. Others, such as Thomas 
            Burrow and Patrick Olivelle, point out that none of the earliest sources that refer to Chanakya mention the name "Vishnugupta". 
            According to these scholars, "Vishnugupta" may have been the personal name of the author whose gotra name was "Kautilya": 
            this person, however, was different from Chanakya. Historian K C Ojha theorizes that Vishnugupta was the redactor of the final 
            recension of the text.</p>
        <p><b>Chanakya</b>
            The penultimate paragraph of the Arthashastra states that the treatise was authored by the person who rescued the country from 
            the Nanda kings, although it does not explicitly name this person. The Maurya prime minister Chanakya played a pivotal role in 
            the overthrow of the Nanda dynasty. Several later texts identify Chanakya with Kautilya or Vishnugupta: Among the earliest sources, 
            Mudrarakshasa is the only one that uses all three names - Kauṭilya, Vishnugupta, and Chanakya - to refer to the same person. Other 
            early sources use the name Chanakya (e.g. Panchatantra), Vishnugupta (e.g. Kamandaka's Nitisara), both Chanakya and Vishnugupta 
            (Dandin's Dashakumaracharita), or Kautilya (e.g. Bana's Kadambari). The Puranas (Vishnu, Vayu, and Matsya) are the only among the 
            ancient texts that use the name "Kautilya" (instead of the more common "Chanakya") to describe the Maurya prime minister.<br>
            Scholars such as R. P. Kangle theorize that the text was authored by the Maurya prime minister Chanakya. Others, such as Olivelle 
            and Thomas Trautmann, argue that this verse is a later addition, and that the identification of Chanakya and Kautilya is a relatively 
            later development that occurred during the Gupta period. Trautmann points out that none of the earlier sources that refer to Chanakya 
            mention his authorship of the Arthashastra.[39] Olivelle proposes that in an attempt to present the Guptas as the legitimate successors 
            of the Mauryas, the author of political treatise followed by the Guptas was identified with the Maurya prime minister.</p>
