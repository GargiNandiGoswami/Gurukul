            <H2>The Unnamed Saint in King Janaka’s Court</H2></center>
            There is a beautiful story of a female saint, who suddenly appeared in the Vichar sabha (a place where debates are held) 
            of King Janaka and questioned Astabakra (son of Kahole) and proved that he wasn’t Brahma Gyani. Then she briefly explained 
            the question posed and asked him to get taught by Janaka Raja (King Janaka) as He too was Brahma Gyani like this unnamed 
            female Saint. Thereafter she disappeared in full view of the court.
            
            <h3>Gargi Vachaknavi</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\gargiv.webp" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Brahmavadini Gargi Vachaknavi, daughter of Vachaknu, is honored as a great natural philosopher, renowned expounder of the 
            Vedas. She is said to have written many hymns in the Rigveda. In the 6th and 8th Brahmana of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, her 
            name is prominent as she participates in the Brahma Yajna, a philosophic debate organised by Brahma Gyani King Janaka of 
            Videha and challenges the Brahma Gyani Sage Yajnavalkya.Gargi was a female Upanishadic thinker who was well-known for her 
            knowledge and participation in royal court debates. Occasionally, women thinkers are mentioned, such as Gargi, who was 
            famous for Learning and participating in royal court debates. Poor people were rarely present in these discussions. 
            The great thinker Shankaracharya later developed many of the Upanishad's ideas.Gargi was the daughter of sage Vachaknu in 
            the lineage of sage Garga (c. 800-500 BCE) and hence named after her father as Gargi Vachaknavi. Right from a young age, 
            Vachaknavi was very intellectual. She acquired knowledge of the Vedas and scriptures and became renowned for her proficiency 
            in these fields of philosophy.Gargi, along with Vadava Pratitheyi and Sulabha Maitreyi are among the prominent females who 
            figure in the Upanishads. She was as knowledgeable in Vedas and Upanishads as men of the Vedic times and could very 
            well contest the male-philosophers in debates. Her name appears in the Grihya Sutras of Asvalayana. She was a leading 
            scholar who also made rich contributions to propagate education.
            
            <h3>Maitreyi</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\maitreyi.webp" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Brahmavadini Maitreyi was a venerated ancient Indian philosopher. Ten hymns in the Rigveda are attributed to Maitreyi, 
            where she explored the concept of Atman in a dialogue with Brahma Gyani Sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.
            Maitreyi, who is also mentioned in a number of Puranas, is regarded as one of the most learned and virtuous women of ancient
            India and symbolizes intellectual women in India. She was a leading scholar who also made rich contributions to propagate 
            education. Maitreyi is an example of the educational opportunities available to women in Vedic India, and their philosophical 
            achievements. She is considered a symbol of Indian intellectual women, and an institution is named in her honour in New Delhi.
            
            <h3>Princess Hemalekha</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\hemalekha.jpg" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Hemalekha (mentioned in Tripura Rahasya) was Guru to her husband (Prince Hemachuda), her Mother-in-law and many others. 
            She slowly and beautifully takes her worldly husband on the path of Brahma Gyan. Such was her power that in time the entire 
            city was full of Brahma Gyanis, where even the parrots spoke of renunciation and Gyan.
            
            <h3>Queen Chudala</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\chudala.webp" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Queen Chudala (mentioned in Yoga Vasistha) became Guru to her Husband, King Sikhidhwaj. She attained Brahma Gyan soon after 
            instructions from scholars. Her story is detailed in Yoga Vasistha.
            
            <h3>Sri Sarada Devi</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\sarda ma.webp" width="400" height="400"><br>
            In recent times Sarada Devi, wife of Ramakrishna Paramhansa, was Guru to many and is considered Divine Incarnate. 
            At Dakshineswar, Sarada Devi stayed in a tiny room in the nahabat (music tower). She stayed at Dakshineswar until 1885, 
            except for short periods when she visited Jayrambati. By this time Ramakrishna had already embraced the monastic life 
            of a sannyasin; as a result, the marriage was never consummated. As a priest, Ramakrishna performed the ritual 
            ceremony—the Shodashi Puja where Sarada Devi was made to sit in the seat of goddess Kali, and worshiped as the divine 
            mother Tripurasundari. According to Swami Saradananda a direct disciple of Ramakrishna, Ramakrishna married to 
            show the world an ideal of a sexless marriage. Ramakrishna regarded Sarada as an incarnation of the Divine Mother, 
            addressing her as Sree Maa (Holy Mother) and it was by this name that she was known to Ramakrishna's disciples.

            Sarada Devi's days began at 3 am. After finishing her ablutions in the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly, she would practice japa and 
            meditation until daybreak. Ramakrishna taught her the sacred mantras, and instructed her how to initiate people and 
            guide them in spiritual life. Sarada Devi is regarded as Ramakrishna's first disciple. Except for her hours of 
            meditation, most of her time was spent in cooking for Ramakrishna and the growing number of his devotees. 
            While Sarada Devi remained completely in the background, her unassuming, warm personality attracted some female devotees 
            to become her lifelong companions.
            
            During Ramakrishna's last days, during which he suffered from throat cancer, Sarada Devi played an important role in 
            nursing him and preparing suitable food for him and his disciples. It is reported that after Ramakrishna's death in 
            August 1886, when Sarada Devi tried to remove her bracelets as the customs dictated for a widow, she had a vision of 
            Ramakrishna in which he said, "I have not passed away, I have gone from one room to another." According to her, whenever 
            she thought of dressing like a widow, she had a vision of Ramakrishna asking her not to do so. 
            After Ramakrishna's death, Sarada Devi continued to play an important role in the nascent religious movement. 
            She remained the spiritual guide of the movement for the next 34 years.
            
            <h3>Bhairavi Brahmani</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\brahmani.jpg" width="400" height="400"><br>
            In 1861, Ramakrishna accepted Bhairavi Brahmani, an orange-robed, middle-aged female ascetic, as a teacher. She carried with 
            her the Raghuvir Shila, a stone icon representing Ram and all Vaishnava deities. She was thoroughly conversant with the texts 
            of Gaudiya Vaishnavism and practised Tantra. According to the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna was experiencing phenomena that accompany 
            mahabhava, the supreme attitude of loving devotion towards the divine, and quoting from the bhakti shastras, she said that 
            other religious figures like Radha and Chaitanya had similar experiences.
            
            The Bhairavi initiated Ramakrishna into Tantra. Tantrism focuses on the worship of shakti and the object of Tantric training 
            is to transcend the barriers between the holy and unholy as a means of achieving liberation and to see all aspects of the 
            natural world as manifestations of the divine shakti. Under her guidance, Ramakrishna went through sixty four major tantric 
            sadhanas which were completed in 1863. He began with mantra rituals such as japa and purascarana and many other rituals 
            designed to purify the mind and establish self-control. He later proceeded towards tantric sadhanas, which generally include 
            a set of heterodox practices called vamachara (left-hand path), which utilise as a means of liberation, activities like eating 
            of parched grain, fish and meat along with drinking of wine and sexual intercourse. According to Ramakrishna and his biographers, 
            Ramakrishna did not directly participate in the last two of those activities, all that he needed was a suggestion of them to 
            produce the desired result. Ramakrishna acknowledged the left-hand tantric path, though it had “undesirable features”, as one 
            of the “valid roads to God-realization”, he consistently cautioned his devotees and disciples against associating with it. 
            The Bhairavi also taught Ramakrishna the kumari-puja, a form of ritual in which the Virgin Goddess is worshiped symbolically 
            in the form of a young girl. Under the tutelage of the Bhairavi, Ramakrishna also learnt Kundalini Yoga. The Bhairavi, with 
            the yogic techniques and the tantra played an important part in the initial spiritual development of Ramakrishna.
            
            <h3>The Avvaiyars</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\avvaiyar.png" width="400" height="400"><br>
            The Avvaiyars  (‘Respectable Women’) was the title of more than one poet who was active during different periods of Tamil 
            literature. The Avvaiyar were some of the most famous and important female poets of the Tamil canon. Abithana Chintamani 
            states that there were three female poets titled Avvaiyar.
            
            Among them, Avvaiyar lived during the Sangam period (c. 1st and 2nd century CE) and had cordial relation with the Tamil 
            chieftains Vēl Pāri and Athiyamān. She wrote 59 poems in the Puṟanāṉūṟu.
            
            Avvaiyar II lived during the period of Kambar and Ottakoothar during the reign of the Chola dynasty in the 10th century. 
            She is often imagined as an old and intelligent lady by Tamil people. She wrote many of the poems that remain very popular 
            even now and are inculcated in school textbooks in Tamil Nadu. These books include a list of dos and don’ts, useful for 
            daily life, arranged in simple and short sentences.
            
            There is a very famous legend that is associated with Avvaiyar, a prominent female poets/ethicist/political activist of 
            Sangam period (Tamil literature), and Naaval Pazham (Jambu) in Tamil Nadu. Avvaiyar, believing to have achieved everything 
            that is to be achieved, is said to have been pondering her retirement from Tamil literary work while resting under Naaval 
            Pazham tree. But she is met with and was wittily jousted by a disguised Murugan (regarded as one of the guardian deities of 
            the Tamil language), who later revealed himself and made her realise that there was still a lot more to be done and learnt. 
            Following this awakening, Avvaiyar is believed to have undertaken a fresh set of literary works, targeted at children. 
            These works, even after a millennium, are often among the very first literature that children are exposed to in Tamil Nadu 
            schools.
            
            <h3>Ubhaya Bharati</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\bharati.jpg" width="400" height="400"><br>
            When Adi Sankara was proceeding on his Jaitra Yatra (victory march), the great scholar Mandana Mishra in Mahishmati presently 
            Mahishi. Sankara entered into a scholarly debate with him. Ubhaya Bharati, the wife of Mandana Mishra, was also a great scholar. She was well-versed in the principles of Ritham, Sathyam, Mahattattwam, etc. It was decided that Mandana Mishra would take to Sannyasa if he were to be defeated in the debate. Sankara chose Ubhaya Bharati to be the adjudicator of the contest. As the debate was in progress, she listened to the arguments and counter arguments with utmost concentration. She was impartial in her judgement and declared Sankara to be the winner. Being one of wisdom, she did not feel dejected that her husband was defeated in the debate. Mandana Mishra took to Sannyasa in accordance with the terms and conditions of the debate. Ubhaya Bharathi, being his Ardhangi (better half), followed suit.
            
            Both husband and wife renounced the world and propagated the path of wisdom. Human life has no value if one does not acquire 
            wisdom. “To have the vision of the effulgent light of Atma, you have to remove the soot of ego covering your mind”. 
            This was the teaching of Ubhaya Bharati. She was living in a hermitage on the banks of the river Ganga, imparting 
            spiritual teachings to women. Many women had become her disciples. Every day in the morning, they used to go 
            the Ganges to have a bath. On the way, there lived a Sannyasi whom people called Brahma Jnani. Truly, 
            he was a renunciant and one of wisdom. However, he was very much attached to a small earthen pot in which 
            he used to preserve water.
            
            One day, he was lying down using the pot as a pillow, lest somebody might steal it. Ubhaya Bharati who was 
            on her way to Ganges with her disciples observed this and remarked, “Though he is one of wisdom, 
            there is a small defect in him. He has renounced the world, but is attached to his earthen pot which he is 
            using as his pillow.” The Sanyasi overheard their conversation and became angry. When Ubhaya Bharati and her 
            disciples were coming back from Ganges, he threw away the pot on the road, just to show that he was not attached to it. 
            Seeing this, Ubhaya Bharati said, “I thought there was only one defect in him -Abhimana (attachment). Now I realise that
            he has another defect also — Ahamkara (ego). How can one with Ahamkara and Abhimana be a Jnani (one of wisdom)?” It was an 
            eye-opener for the Sanyas. Ubhaya Bharati toured the length and breadth of the country preaching and propagating the path 
            of wisdom.
            
            <h3>Saint Andal</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\andal.jpg" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Tiruppavai is a sacred poem composed with utmost love and devotion By Sri Andal at the young age of 15 years of age in 
            praise of the Lord Vishnu (also known as Perumal, Sri Ranganath). These are 30 Stanzas known as Pasurams that are written 
            in Tamil (South Indian Language) and is also considered as a part of the ‘Divya Prabandha’ (Holy Texts) compiled by the 
            twelve Alvars of Vaishnava (Followers of Vishnu).
            
            Tiruppavai is recited during the sacred month of Margashira (also known as Marzazhi in Tamil), that is in the Auspicious 
            month of Dhanur masa. Dhanur masa is considered so Holy and sacred that during this month, no Vydic Hindu marriages take 
            place as every one want to devote all their energy and time in the Holy name of the Lord Sriman Narayana.
            
            Andal is an 8th century Tamil saint and one of the twelve Alwars (saints) and the only woman Alwar of Vaishnavism. She 
            wrote the great Tamil works of Tiruppavai (30 verses) and Naacchiyaar Tirumozhi (143 verses). Andal is known for her 
            unwavering devotion to Lord Vishnu.
            
            Andal was discovered under a Tulasi plant in the temple garden of Srivilliputtur, by Vishnuchitta who was one of the 
            most revered saints in Hinduism, Periyalwar. She was named Kodhai or Goda. As she grew, her love and devotion for 
            the Lord grew to the extent that she decided to marry none but the Lord Himself. She started to live in a dream world 
            with her beloved Lord and was constantly fantasizing about marrying Him. Goda made flower garlands for her beloved Lord 
            at the temple. She started wearing the flower garland which was meant to be offered to the Lord before sending it to the 
            temple. One day, she was caught red-handed by her father. The Lord appeared to Vishnuchitta in his dream and told him that 
            He whole-heartedly accepted Goda’ s offering. From this day on, Goda was respected by the devotees and came to be known as 
            “Andal”, the girl who “ruled” over the Lord. She is also known as “Soodi kodutha Sudarkodi”. Periyalwar took Andal to 
            Srirangam to marry Her to the Lord Ranganatha. She entered the temple sanctum and became one with him.
            
            <h3>Meera Bai (Mira Bai)</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\meerabai.webp" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Saint Meera, also known as Meera Bai, was a 16th-century poet and devotee of Krishna. She is a celebrated Bhakti saint, 
            particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition. Meera Bai was born into a Rajput royal family of Kudki district of Pali, 
            Rajasthan, India.Scholars acknowledge that Meera was one of the central poet-saints of the Bhakti movement, a period in 
            Indian history rife with religious conflicts. Yet, they simultaneously question the extent to which Meera was a canonical 
            projection of social imagination that followed, where she became a symbol of people's suffering and a desire for an 
            alternative. 

            If one accepts that someone very akin to the Mira legend [about persecution and her devotion] existed as an actual social 
            being, the power of her convictions broke the brutal feudal relationships that existed at that time. The Mira Bai of the 
            popular imagination, then, is an intensely anachronistic figure by virtue of that anticipatory radical democracy which 
            propels Meera out of the historicity that remains nonetheless ascribed to her. She goes beyond the shadowy realms of 
            the past to inhabit the very core of a future which is embodied within the suffering of a people who seek an alternative.
            
            The continued influence of Meera, in part, has been her message of freedom, her resolve and right to pursue her devotion 
            to Krishna and her spiritual beliefs as she felt drawn to despite her persecution. Her appeal and influence in 
            Indian culture, writes Edwin Bryant, is from her emerging, through her legends and poems, as a person "who stands up for 
            what is right and suffers bitterly for holding fast to her convictions, as other men and women have", yet she does so with 
            a language of love, with words painting the "full range of emotions that mark love, whether between human beings or between 
            human and divine".
            
            <h3>Akka Mahadevi</h3>
            <img src="c:\Users\goswa\OneDrive\Desktop\akka-mahadevi.gif" width="400" height="400"><br>
            Akka Mahadevi was one of the early female poets of the Kannada languageand a prominent 
            personality in the Veerashaiva Bhakti movement of the 12th century. Her 430 extant Vachana poems (a form of spontaneous 
            mystical poems), and the two short writings called Mantrogopya and the Yogangatrividhi are considered her most notable 
            contribution to Kannada literature. She composed relatively fewer poems than other saints of the movement. 
            Yet the term Akka (“elder Sister”), which is an honorific given to her by great Veerashaiva saints such as 
            Basavanna, Siddharama and Allamaprabhu is an indication of her contribution to the spiritual discussions held at the 
            “Anubhava Mantapa”[citation needed]. She is in hindsight seen as an inspirational woman for Kannada literature and the 
            history of Karnataka. She is known to have considered the god Shiva (‘Chenna Mallikarjuna’) as her husband, 
            (traditionally understood as the ‘madhura bhava’ or ‘madhurya’ form of devotion).
