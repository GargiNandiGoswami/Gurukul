        <P>This is the time when the Vedic Gurukul system was developed, and its structure and principles were refined. The core principles 
            that were envisaged by rishis still hold to the very essence even in this modern age. The learning system that was set up for 
            learning Vedas slowly evolved into the application of learning vocational as well as scientific systems.
            Though there isn’t much information available except some gurukuls that have been discussed in Brahmanas (commentaries on Vedas).

            <p>Some of the famous rishis/gurus who find mentioned in the Indian epics Ramayana and Mahabharata also ran famous gurukuls. 
            Rama and Krishna also studied in Gurukuls under Vashishtha and Sandeepani respectively.</p>
            
            <B>Maharishi Vishwamitra</B>
            <p>He wrote the Gayatri Mantra and was also the teacher of Lord Ram and Laxman. He taught them the usage of celestial weapons 
            (Devastras) to be used in warfare. He guided them in defeating powerful demons like Tataka, Maricha, and Subahu.</p>
            
            <B>Maharishi Valmiki</B>
            <p>Sita took refuge at his ashram and gave birth to Luv and Kush, he taught them shastras and the art of using weapons. He also 
                wrote Ramayana.</p>
            
            <B>Maharishi Vashishtha</B>
            <p>He was one of the great Saptrishis. He was a teacher to Dashrath’s sons Ram, Lakshman, Bharat, and Shatrughan.</p>
            
           <B> Guru Dronacharya</B>
           <p> He was the guru of all the Kauravas and Pandavas, who learned under guru Dronacharya. His gurukul was situated somewhere near 
            the present-day “Gurugram” which also gets its name from.</p>

            <B>Naimisharanya</B>
            <p>It was one of the most important hermitages. It was more like a university. Saunka rishi was the Kulapati of this hermitage 
                which means at least 10,000 disciples and acharyas used to reside in this hermitage at one time. This is famous by the name 
                Chakra Teerth, Neemsar in the state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
            
            <B>Kanva Rishi Hermitage</B>
            <p>Kanva rishi’s hermitage is described in vivid detail in Mahabharata. It was situated on the banks of the river Malini, 
                a tributary of the Sarayu River. This hermitage was not a stand-alone but many other hermitages were there in its vicinity.</p>
            
            <B>Vyasa’s hermitage</B>
            <p>It was one of the most famous seats of learning. Vyasa compiled all the Vedas in this hermitage.</p>
            
            <B>Buddhist period</B>
            <p>Buddha was born in the 19th century BCE and Ashoka of the Mauryan empire ascended the throne somewhere around 1500 BCE as 
            claimed by Mr. Vedveer Arya in his commendable work on the dating of Adi Sankaracharya and Buddha.
            Due to the initial patronage by Maurayan Ashoka, Buddhism spread fast. It didn’t have as much effect on the gurukul system 
            as it had on the principles of Vedic Dharma (as Hinduism was called back then). The Gurukul system continued flourishing, 
            but much earlier Vedic Vishwavidyalayas were slowly converted into Bodh maha viharas as was the case with Takshashila and 
            many others. Vedic dharma took the backseat while Buddhism was in the driving seat.</p>
            
            <b>Universities of ancient India</b>
            <p>Some of these gurukuls evolved organically into what we call universities nowadays. The reasons may have ranged from the 
                spread of their fame far and wide and students might have started flocking to these well-known places giving rise to universities. 
                These served as centers/institutions for advanced learning.
                
                According to one estimate, there were well over 50 universities in ancient India at one time. Some of these famous ones 
                are Takshashila, Nalanda, Vikramshila, and Valbhi University, Odantapuri, Mithila University, Telhara University, 
                Sharda Peeth Temple University, Pushpagiri University, Somapura University, Bikrampur University.
                
                Some of the famous alumni of Takshashila(Taxila) were the noted grammarian Panini, who wrote the famous book Ashtadhyayi, 
                and Acharya Chanakya, who wrote Arthashastra.</p>
            
            <B>Why Gurukul system decline?</B>
            <p>The Mahabharata war proved to be a milestone in Indian history. The intellectual vacuum created after the war resulted in 
                the deterioration of the societal structure which gave rise to darshan that rejected Vedas viz. Buddha darshan, Jainas, 
                Ajivikas, etc.
                
                But as all good things must come to an end, the gurukul system also faced challenges from foreign rulers. Foreign invader 
                brought their education systems with them and forced them on the indigenous population.</p>
            
            <B>Muslim rule</B>
            <p>Following the destruction of Nalanda, Vikramshila, and Udyantpuri. The continuous persecution and destruction at the hands 
                of Muslim rulers.
                
                A painting titled “The end of Buddhist Monks” shows the destruction of Nalanda by Bakhtiyar Khilji in 1193. Besides Nalanda, 
                he destroyed Vikramshila and Odantapuri universities as well. The destruction has been recorded by Minhaj-i Siraj Juzjani in 
                Tabaqat-i-Nasiri.</p>
            
            <I>Destruction of nalanda by bakhtiyar khilji</I>
            <p>The first successful attack by Muslims on India was in 712 by Bin Qasim. But after a brief period of control, most parts of 
                Sindh and Balochistan. For the next 500 years, they couldn’t control any further part due to some decisive victories of the 
                period. The attacks were renewed under Mahmud of Ghazni, but most of these were raids on the periphery of India.
                
                Then Mahmud of Ghor was successful in setting up his base after winning the battle of Tarain in 1192. The reason for sharing 
                this background is to show that only after the 1200s, Muslims were able to set up any base in India albeit a small one.</p>

            <B>British rule</B>
            <p>After winning the debate with “Minute on Education(1835)“, Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British Politician brought radical 
                changes to education in India. After that, the company stopped all funding to the gurukuls. Societal apathy mixed with 
                sustained attacks from Muslim rulers compounded their decline. But it was the British who delivered the death blow to the 
                already dying Gurukul system. Soon it becomes fashionable to send your child to your convent school and the rest is history.
                
                In the aftermath of British policies, the 19th century saw a steep decline in the number of gurukuls all over India. India, 
                from being one of the biggest economies in the world in the 1800s to being one of the poorest in the world in 1914 made 
                education unaffordable to most Indians. So the remaining gurukuls were shut down too.
                
                We analyzed the data collected by various British officers between 1820 – 1880 and published our research titled How many 
                gurukuls were there in India before British rule? We have divided our research into three phases viz the status of education 
                during the initial phase (1770 – 1830), middle phase (1830 – 1870), and last phase (1870 – 1947). Also, do check out our 
                critical study of Macaulayism in India.</p>
            
            <B>After 1947</B>
            <p>The governments of independent India behaved more or less the same as their predecessors. There was no focus on the government 
                toward the indigenous gurukul education system. The momentum that it gained during the 1880s – 1930s was completely lost after 
                independence.</p>
            
            <B>21st Century</B>
            <p>The status of the gurukul system of education is precisely the same as it was in the 20th century i.e. pathetic. Though there 
                has been a visible change in the number of so-called gurukuls that I wouldn’t even consider gurukul. A residential school 
                doesn’t become a gurukul by default if you start doing yagya every day which sadly is the case with most gurukuls right now.
                
                The number of gurukul in India has increased a bit in the last decade but most of them are schools rather than gurukul. 
                According to a study conducted by Vediconcepts in April 2022, the total number of gurukul in India is 4500.</p>
            
            <B>Revival in the 19th Century</B>
            <p>First Swami Dayananda Saraswati and then Swami Shraddhanand set up many gurukuls in India by the end of the 19th century and 
                starting of the 20th century. Since then, Arya Samaj has been running many Vedic gurukuls all over India.
                
                In the era of the Indian national and cultural renaissance of the 19th century, many Gurukuls were established. These gurukuls 
                were based on the tradition of ancient Gurukula. These gurukuls played an important role in spreading the national spirit. 
                Although the system of ancient Gurukuls cannot be re-established in modern conditions, their ideals can be adopted with 
                necessary changes.
                
                But again after independence Gurukul system fell out of the favor of the govt. The government of independent India didn’t 
                pay attention to Gurukuls at all. Nowadays, even the gurukuls set up by Swami Shraddhanand have become nothing more than 
                residential convent schools.</p>
            
            <B>The unbecoming of gurukuls in independent India</B>
            <p>The abovementioned gurukuls too in the latter half of the 20th century kept on losing their gurukul traits and went on becoming 
                name-sake gurukuls only. Some of the problems they have faced are:-<br>
                
                i) CBSE pattern subject i.e. no Indian knowledge being imparted<br>
                ii) Providing an option of day boarding<br>
                iii) Too many facilities<br>
                iv) Gurukul doesn’t mean residential school<br>
                vi) High fees<br>
                vii) Present status of Vedic gurukuls in India<br>
                There are some Vedic gurukuls still functioning in India. Though these gurukuls do not compare well to the glory of ancient 
                gurukuls. Still, it is heartening to see some of them functioning defying all the odds. We have prepared a list of all the 
                Vedic gurukuls currently functioning in India and categorized by state. We do not claim this list to be completely exhaustive. 
                But we’ll try to keep it as extensive as we could.</p>
            
            <b><i>Scholarly works on Gurukul System</i></b>
            <p>Dharampal, authored a book titled “The beautiful tree: Indigenous Indian education in the eighteenth century” in which he 
                presents and analyses the data collected by British officers(in official as well as personal capacity) mostly in the first 
                half of the 19th century.
                Prof. Marmar Mukhopadhyay compiled a book titled Total Quality Management in Education deriving insights from the ancient 
                education system. He also devised the concept of Multi-Channel Learning based on gurukul’s pedagogy.
                Ankur Joshi authored a research paper titled – Elementary education in Bharat (that is India): insights from a postcolonial 
                ethnographic study of a Gurukul and A post-colonial perspective towards education in Bharat
                The speech was given by Kum.B.Nivedita, Secretary, Educational Wing, Vivekananda Kendra, Kanyakumari at IIT-Madras
                “Educational heritage of ancient India(2017)” and “Revisiting educational heritage of ancient India(2022)” by Sahana Singh.
                Relevance of Gurukul system in present times
                Gurukul’s system of education was the foundation due to which ancient Indian society was able to make so many materials 
                as well as spiritual advancements. If India wants to again become the knowledge house for the world, then we have no other 
                option but to look into it.
                
                We have done a lot of research and found that the gurukul system is much more innovative, and resilient, and provides social 
                justice and flexibility compared to the modern education system. But to suit the conditions of today, we should tweak it a bit.</p>
            
            <b>Do we need the Gurukul system back in India?</b>
            <p>From the above discussion, we can see the shortcomings of the present education system. To progress as a society we need to 
                remove its shortcomings and retain its positive points. So the best way is to fuse both systems together and create a hybrid 
                containing the best of both worlds.
                
                Modern gurukuls need not carry the baggage that bogged them down. But it must carry forward all the great things it had to offer. 
                The openness of the educational environment can only be made permanent with the Gurukul system. Its holistic approach will give it 
                an unfair advantage.
                
                A gurukul is the ideal option for a child’s complete development because it doesn’t just give academic knowledge but prepares them 
                for every part of life. It is a system of producing full-fledged human beings rather than the half-baked minions that we are 
                producing with the current system.</p>
            
            <b>How Does The Gurukul System Work?</b>
            <p>Gurukuls had an important contribution to the development of Indian civilization and culture. Gurukuls were often run by 
                Brahmin householders both inside and outside the villages or cities. Grihastha scholars and sometimes even Vanprasthi would 
                attract learners from far and wide. They keep them in their family for many years (ideal and legislation was up to 
                twenty-five years) and educated them.</p>
            
           <b><i> Constituents of a Gurukul</i></b>
           <p> The analogy of the human body fits perfectly on a Gurukul. Acharya is like the head of a gurukul who runs a gurukul.<br>
            1. Acharya<br>
            2. Building or location<br>
            3. A pattern (method) for delivering education<br>
            4. Subjects taught e.g. Vedas, Vedangas, Mathematics, Language, etc.</p>

            <b><i>Methods of teaching in the gurukul system</i></b> 
            Gurukul’s system of learning employs many methods. Some of these methods are very well known and employed extensively like 
            learning by memorization. But Gurukul education system goes much beyond the traditional methods of learning/teaching. 
            It employs experiential learning, natural learning, practical learning methods, etc.
            
            In the traditional system, a student has very limited avenues of learning. He learns mostly inside the rooms. In contrast, a student in a gurukul is not limited by the walls of the classroom. Instead, the whole environment around him is treated as a laboratory. He learns from the conduct of the acharya. He learns from everything around him/her.
            
            <b>Gurudakshina</b>
            <p>As a reward, the Brahmacari child either offered his services to the Guru and his family. They could also pay off the fee 
                at the time of completion. But gifts containing such financial rewards and other things were given as Dakshina only after 
                initiation and before starting the Guru Vidya Daan. The doors of the Gurukuls were open to all the deserving students, 
                rich and poor.
                
                Disciple’s, as well as Acharya’s life, was simple, reverent, devotional, and based on renunciation. The disciple would 
                learn from the Guru’s personality and conduct by staying with the acharya. In the Gurukuls, all the scriptures and 
                sciences known till then were taught. Upon completion of the education, the Guru would test the disciple and give initiation.
                
                After completing the Samavartan Sanskar, the acharya would send him/her to their respective family. The disciples would 
                then give Dakshina to the guru according to their power. But poor students could also be freed from it.</p>
            
            <b>Types of institutions</b>
           <p> Various types of institutions that were used for knowledge sharing and learning in ancient India:
            
            Gurukul – where students stayed in the ashram and studied with the Guru
            Sabha or Council – where experts would discuss & share the knowledge attained by them.
            Tapasthali – These were big gatherings and discourses held here yielded knowledge. Naimisharanya was one such place.
            Shashtrarth: Not an institution but a tradition that helped in the refining of knowledge. India has a tradition of Shashtrarth of at least 18000 years.
            The system of Gurukuls continued for a long time in India. The state considered it its duty to make all arrangements for the maintenance of the acharyas and gurukuls. When Kautas, the disciple of Varatantu, despite being very poor, urged him to get some Dakshina, the Guru got angry and asked for an impossible amount of fourteen crores of gold coins. Kautas considered it right to get that money from King Raghu, and that unfortunate king who donated everything in the Yagya decided to attack Kubera to fulfill the demand of that Brahmin child.
            
            Ujjain’s world-foremost astronomical observatory attracted great astronomers like Aryabhata, Vrah Mihira, Brahmagupta, etc.</p>
            
            <b>Admission process in Gurukuls</b>
            <p>Upanayana Sanskar
                Upanayana sanskar or the sacred thread ceremony is usually performed at the age of 8 to 12 years. The student is taken to 
                the acharya and if the acharya accepts him to be his shishya, he performs an Upanayana Sanskar also known as Yajopavit 
                sanskar.
                
                Upanayana ceremony is usually held on Shravani Parva (Raksha Bandhan) which falls on the Purnima of Shravana month which 
                marks the beginning of a period of learning. The month of Shravana is named after Shravana nakshatra but is also related 
                to Shruti (Vedas). Shravana month is dedicated to learning, reading, and hearing scriptures like Vedas, Ramayana, etc.</p>
            
            
            
           <i><b>A typical day in gurukul</b></i>
            <p>The routine followed in Gurukuls is very rigid. A typical day in a gurukul starts in the early hours of sunrise usually 3:45 am 
                and includes Yoga, martial arts, Yagya, learning & daily chores like cleaning, cooking, etc.</p>
            
            <b><i>What is taught in gurukul?</i></b>
            <p>It is widely assumed in society that gurukuls only prepare brahmins who can perform some rituals. Instead, in addition 
                to the study of Vedas, many subjects are taught in a gurukul.
            
                The gurukul system takes care of the holistic learning of a child. The main subjects offered in the gurukul system are as follows:-<br>
                
                1. Astronomy<br>
                2. Darshan (Philosophy)<br>
                3. Mathematics<br>
                4. Science<br>
                5. Dharmasutras (Study of Laws)<br>
                6. Brahmanas<br>
                7. Arthashastra (Political Science)<br>
                8. Ayurveda (Medicine)<br>
                9. Dhanurvedam (Defense Studies)<br>
                10. Vedas<br>
                11. Vedanga<br>
                These are just a few subjects that used to be taught in gurukuls. There are many more like music, pottery, etc. Skill 
                development is one of the main advantages of the Gurukul system. The flexibility of the gurukul system makes it a 
                viable option in these modern times of fast-changing requirements.</p>
            
           <h2><b><i> Gurukul system of education Vs Modern Education</i></b><h2></h2>
            <i>Objectives of the gurukul system of education</i>
            <p>Gurukul system was started way back to share knowledge that has been achieved till then. In addition, gurukul’s other 
                objectives were:-<br>
                
                1. Transmission of knowledge<br>
                2. Preparing children for their future<br>
                3. Instilling knowledge and affinity towards science and knowledge in general<br>
                4. Passing on of knowledge and culture through generations<br>
                5. Disciplined life<br>
                6. Guru shishya tradition<br></p>

            <i>Advantages of the gurukul system of education</i>
            <p>Gurukuls system, in addition to being flexible & innovative, provides many advantages over the modern education system. 
                Its holistic learning potential makes it a much sought-after alternative to traditional modern education. While living 
                with the acharya, students learn from the conduct of the acharya. Other main advantages include:-<br>
                
                1. Holistic & Experiential learning<br>
                2. Wide variety of subjects to study in & Choice-based system<br>
                3. Mental and spiritual development<br>
                4. Student-centric education & Value-based<br>
                5. Humanity and equality<br>
                The whole society is responsible for education and the student doesn’t depend on their parents.
                Doing their daily chores makes students independent and helps them gain skills needed for sustenance.
                The ancient Indian Gurukul system produced great mathematicians, astronomers, and lots of knowledge of Science and Technology were generated in ancient India.</p>
            
            <i>Disadvantages of the gurukul system of education</i>
            <p>Gurukul’s system of education has many benefits but just like everything, it also has some drawbacks. 
                The main drawback of the gurukul system can be its simplicity. In this day and age when things sell based on 
                their outside appearance, gurukuls can be at loss. In addition, there are some more disadvantages given below:-<br>
                
                1. Gurukul system emphasizes simple living and high thinking principles which may not appeal to the upper class.
                2. Materialism is kept under check in gurukul settings so that there is a limited distraction.
                3. Students are made to survive with minimum means, which may not be liked by some.
                4. Flaws in the Modern Education System
                The concept of Gurukul has now disappeared. The modern education system encourages students to compete with each 
                other and be involved in a rat race with no end. There is no emphasis on personality development, ethical training, 
                or moral conscience development.
                
                Education has become very commercial. Thus, instead of being a tool to empower the youth of the world, it has become a 
                tool for making money. The lack of stress on the importance of mental and physical health is very concerning as well. 
                Education is becoming a tiresome process where students need to sit in one place for a long time. This has caused stress, 
                anxiety, and depression episodes to rise.</p>
