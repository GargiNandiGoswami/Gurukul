    <P>The gita in the title of the Bhagavad Gita means "song of the god". Religious leaders and scholars interpret the word Bhagavad in 
        a number of ways. Accordingly, the title has been interpreted as "the word of God" by the theistic schools, "the words of the Lord", 
        "the Divine Song", and "Celestial Song" by others.<BR>
        In India, its Sanskrit name is often written as Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, श्रीमद् भगवद् गीता (the latter two words often written as a single 
        word भगवद्गीता), where the Shrimad prefix is used to denote a high degree of respect. The Bhagavad Gita is not to be confused with the 
        Bhagavata Puran, which is one of the eighteen major Puranas dealing with the life of the Hindu God Krishna and various avatars of Vishnu.
        The work is also known as the Iswara Gita, the Ananta Gita, the Hari Gita, the Vyasa Gita, or the Gita.</P>
    <P>The Bhagavad Gita is set in a narrative framework of dialogue between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his charioteer guide Krishna, 
        an avatar of Vishnu. At the start of the Kurukshetra War between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, Arjuna despairs thinking about the 
        violence and death the war will cause in the battle against his kin and becomes emotionally preoccupied with a dilemma. Wondering if 
        he should renounce the war, Arjuna seeks the counsel of Krishna, whose answers and discourse constitute the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna 
        counsels Arjuna to "fulfil his Kshatriya (warrior) duty" for the upholding of dharma. The Krishna–Arjuna dialogue covers a broad range 
        of spiritual topics, touching upon moral and ethical dilemmas, and philosophical issues that go far beyond the war that Arjuna faces. 
        The setting of the text in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the struggles of human life.</P>
